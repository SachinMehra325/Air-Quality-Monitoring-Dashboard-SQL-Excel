# 🌍 Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard (SQL + Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world air pollution data to identify the most polluted states, cities, and monitoring stations.

The objective was to clean, analyze, and visualize air quality data using PostgreSQL and Excel to generate meaningful business insights.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Air pollution is a major environmental and public health issue.  
This project answers the following key business questions:

- Which state has the highest average AQI?
- Which cities show the worst air quality?
- Which monitoring stations report the highest pollution levels?
- What percentage of pollution falls under the Severe category?
- Which pollutant (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.) contributes the most?
